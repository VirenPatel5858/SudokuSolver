We have used Jupyter notebook to run our python code and we have added a Sudoku_solver.ipynb, which is the jupyter notebook. To get the solutions for every puzzle you need to change the file name of the puzzles in the line "pd.read_csv("Soduku1.csv",header = None)"

"Soduku1.csv","Soduku2.csv","Soduku3.csv","Soduku4.csv","Soduku5.csv","Soduku6.csv"

These files contain all the 6 puzzles given in the project. You just need to change the file name and wait for the solution.

We have also attached Sudoku_Solver.py file that contains the python code we developed.
